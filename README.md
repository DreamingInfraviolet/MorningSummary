# MorningSummary
(WIP) Creates and presents a morning daily summary

# Introduction

Are you tired of having to check a dozen things every morning? Wouldn't it be nice
to have a personal assistant automatically narrate a summary of your upcoming day to you?
If so, then this might be the project for you!

But maybe not. This is a very small-scale project primarily for my personal use.
As such, documentation and a decent build system is perhaps yet to come.
It scours the web for information I check often, combines it into a readable format,
and the plan is to have it narrate the summary when desired. Basically it's a small
attempt to help automate my life.

It'd be difficult to extend this to a wider audience, as many of the data sources
are personalies to what I use. However, if any other developer wants to take this
and modify it into something else, feel free to do so!
